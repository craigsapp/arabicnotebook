<h2> About </h2>

<p>

This website is my digital notebook for an
introductory Arabic language class taught by <a
href="https://dlcl.stanford.edu/people/ramzi-salti?q=people/ramzi-salti"
target=new>Ramzi Salti</a> at Stanford University.  The website is used
to study the weekly vocabulary assignments.  The main page has groups
of word lists which can be navigated by clicking on the entries in the
sidebar on the main page.

</p>

<p>

The main page has several keyboard commands:

<table class="keylist">

<colgroup>
<col style="width:80px; background:#eee;">

</colgroup>

	<td>Toggle visibility of <span class="purple">Arabic</span>

<h2> Searching </h2>

<p>

The search field on the top right of the page will search for Arabic
or English words/phrases which contain the text typed into this field.
The searches are done ignoring the case of the letters, so upper or lower
case letters can be used.  If you press backspace in the search field
until it becomes empty, a list of all vocabulary entries will be shown.
The above keyboard commands also operate on the search-results page.

</p>

<p>

When searching specifically for the transliteration of "<span class=query>ح</span>", use the <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet target=new>Arabic
chat alphabet</a> letter "<span class=query>7</span>". 
Likwise, 
"<span class=query>6</span>" 
can be used to search specifically for 
"<span class=query>ط</span>", and
"<span class=query>9</span>" for
"<span class=query>ص</span>" in transliterations.

</p>

<p>

The search field accepts <a target=new
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>regular
expressions</a>.  Here are some example uses of regular expressions (click
on the search queries to see the resulting matches).


<table class="keylist">
<colgroup>
<col style="width:80px; background:#eee;">
<col>
</colgroup>

<tr>
	<td class=query>^q</td>
	<td>Find entries starting with the letter "q".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>\bq</td>
	<td>Find <i>words</i> starting with the letter "q". "\b" means a word
	 must stop or start at this point in the match (stands for
	word "boundary").</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>\bhe\b</td>
	<td>Find word "he".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>\wq</td>
	<td>Find words that contain "q", but not at start of word. "\w" means
	the opposite of "\b": the word cannot start or stop at this point
	in the match.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>qa+si+r</td>
	<td>Match to "qasir", "qaasir", "qasiir", or "qaasiir".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>k[aeiouyw]*t+[aeiouyw]*b</td>
	<td>Find consonant sequence "KTB" within a word with any 
	number of vowels between the letters, allowing for the T 
	to be doubled.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>his|her</td>
	<td>Find entries which have either "his" or "her" (or both of them).
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>\bhis\b|\bher\b</td>
	<td>Find entries which have either or both complete words "his" or "her".
</tr>

<tr>
	<td class=query>بكم</td>
	<td>Arabic words can also be searched for.</td>
</tr>
